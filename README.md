# About Me

Hey there! My name is ``LuckyEcho``. I've been coding for around `8` years now. It all started back in 2016 when I all of the sudden became very interested in coding. It all seemed very interesting to be able to create thing and program in a matter of hours or days. I started coding on Roblox, as this was the most popular game platform at the time for simple programming. I kept programming on this platform for the next 6 years, becoming very good at it. During the time I also learnt `HTML5`, `JS`, `C`, `C++`, and some `C#`. 

I loved ``JavaScript``, because it was used in a lot of other programming languages. I decided to learn some more languages based off these, such as ``p5.js`` and ``p5.play``. I've made a fair few websites in my time with ``HTML5``, and tinkered around with ``Node.js`` and ``Socket.io``. I created some games here in there, but I realized that it wasn't really plausible to create a game in ``JavaScipt``, so I decided to move onto a different platform.

In ``2022``, I moved onto ``Unity``. I played around with it and lost interest pretty quickly. I realized that maybe I wasn't ready for a whole new platform to learn. I also hadn't learnt that much ``C#``. You may be thinking, *Why not just use visual scripting?* Well, to that I say this, coding and building with blocks are whole entire different things. I would much rather learn the typing part rather than building with blocks. So, I kind of went off and on ``Unity``.

### The Move To Unity

---
It hit ``2023`` and I decided as my new year resolution to learn something new. I decided for this to be ``Unity``, and so I began my journey of learning ``Unity``. I've been working with ``Unity`` ever since this that day, and I'm current working on some new games that are planned to be published on ``Steam``.

#### Current Games

- Freerunners 


### My Experience
---
As I've said above, I've learnt a lot in my time of coding. I don't have much to show here, but if you want to see some more of the my *old... old* games you can visit my ``Roblox`` profile here:

Please note that the ``profile is not active``, as I've quit Roblox now because of the bad games and people on there. I've moved to better things I believe, and also better things in life.
